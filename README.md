# Rubicon Protocol

Rubicon is the first decentralized protocol that is aimed at developing and ushering in the emergence of equity markets on the Ethereum blockchain. The inefficiencies that exist between firms and capital in traditional finance pose a key problem that Rubicon aims to solve. Rubicon replaces traditional intermediaries and costly third parties with open-source code in order to democratize, open, and accelerate global equity markets. 

## Protocol Overview

There are a number of key smart contracts that facilitate the governance and operation of Rubicon. Please see below for an overview of our current smart contract infrastructure.

At a high level, Rubicon revolves around a core smart contract \(MatchingMarket.sol\) that facilitates the peer-to-peer transfer of security tokens, digital assets, and any ERC-20 compliant token. Additionally, Rubicon and its governance token, RBCN, leverage a number of smart contracts to facilitate the decentralization of the protocol, community governance, and future iterations of the protocol.
