# RBCN

RBCN is the governance token of Rubicon and allows for the decentralization of the platform, community governance, and future developments of the protocol. RBCN is a freely tradeable ERC-20 compliant token which allows users to propose new changes to the protocol, vote on proposals to the protocol, and delegate their vote to another address. The governance architecture and functionality of RBCN is influenced by the open source work done at https://compound.finance and the $COMP governance token.

51% of the fixed RBCN supply will be given to users of the protocol over time for free. This enables the gradual decentralization of the protocol and helps to ensure that the Rubicon protocol can operate as a DAO that will ultimately serve the equity market participants of tomorrow.
